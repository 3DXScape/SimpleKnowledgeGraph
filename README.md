# Simple Knowledge Graph
This is an experimental minimalist representation of domain-specific classes, properties, and relationships suitable for computation on ontologies.
Elements are given unique identifiers so that ontologies may be linked and artifacts characterising examples - for example, images of instance of a class - may be associated.
